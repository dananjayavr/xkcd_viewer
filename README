xkcd_viewer lets you view that beloved geeky comic strip xkcd from your command-line.
I created this while I was experimenting with the HTML parser BeautifulSoup. So In order to
run this program, you need to have BeautifulSoup installed. I frankly think if you're the kind
of person who reads xkcd regularly and need to access it from the command-line, your technical skills 
are more than enough to install BeautifulSoup for your system.

The Usage of the program is fairly straightforward. Just download the files and run the 
xkcd_gui.py script. And follow the on-screen Instructions. (There aren't many)

Requirements:

Python 2.X
BeautifulSoup

also this program requires pygtk, which I believe is already included
in your Python installation. (Tested in Ubuntu)
